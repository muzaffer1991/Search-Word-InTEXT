Dynamic NAT has some similarities and differences compared to static NAT. Like static
NAT, the NAT router creates a one-to-one mapping between an inside local and inside
global address and changes the IP addresses in packets as they exit and enter the inside
network. However, the mapping of an inside local address to an inside global address happens dynamically.
